## Registration

**Waitlists**: The general seats available in this class usually fill up very quickly. 
Once the general seats are taken, the only way to register for the course is to sign up for the waiting list. For questions about the waiting list policies, see [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists). You should sign up for the waiting list even if it is long; a lot of students tend to drop courses. Signing up for the waiting list also makes it more likely that we will open up extra sessions, expand class sizes, or offer additional courses on these topics. I have no control over the situation and I cannot help you bypass the waitlist list.

**Prerequisites**: see [here](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?tname=subj-course&course=330&campuscd=UBC&dept=CPSC&pname=subjarea). If you do not meet the prerequisites, see [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/prerequisites) and [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/rules-about-cpsc-appeals-undergraduate-students). I was told that students should not visit the front desk in the CS main office about prerequisite issues, because the folks at the front desk do not have the authority to resolve prerequisite issues.

**Auditing**: if the course is full, we cannot accommodate auditors. If there is space and you would like to audit the course, please contact the instructor.

## Grading
 
**Note: the grading scheme was changed on March 24, 2020 based on a directive from the Dean of Science for all Faculty of Science courses.**  For more information, see [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/k1gx4b3djbv3ph?cid=319).

The **updated** grading scheme for the course is as follows:

| Component  | Weight (Option 1) | Weight (Option 2) |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Assignments |      30%        |        45%        |
| Midterm     |     20%         |        30%        |
| Final       |     30%         |        5%         |
| Participation  |      20%        |       20%         |

Your final course grade will be the higher of your final grade under Option 1 and your final grade under Option 2. You do not need to contact me to specify the option you are choosing.

This next part remains unchanged:

The plan is that most of the assignments will contribute equally towards the overall Assignments grade. However, this is not yet finalized in case, for example, the last assignment ends up particularly short or long due to timing. Furthermore, I will drop your lowest homework grade.

For the full policy on grades, see [this document](grades.md).

## Midterm

The midterm exam will take place on **Thursday, Feb 13 in class from 11:05am to 12:20pm** (75 minutes). The exam is closed book except for one double-sided "cheat sheet" on letter-size paper. The notes need not be handwritten or even written by yourself (i.e., you can share).

**Missed midterm exam**. There is no makeup midterm exam. If you miss the midterm exam, you must provide a justified and documented reason to the instructor. If you have missed the midterm exam for a justified reason, the weight of the midterm component of the course will be transferred to the final exam.

## Final exam

The final exam will take place on **Friday, April 24, 2020 at 12:00-2:30pm** Pacific Daylight Time. ~~The exam is closed book except for two double-sided "cheat sheet" on letter-size paper. The notes don't have to be handwritten or even written by yourself (i.e., you can share).~~ The exam is open book, meaning you are allowed to consult course materials, the internet, etc. However, you are NOT allowed to communicate with anyone else in any way during the exam. The exam will be distribution via GitHub in the same way as assignments.

## Code of conduct

- If you plan to engage in non-course-related activity in lecture (Facebook, YouTube, chatting with friends, etc), please sit in the last two rows of the room to avoid distracting your classmates.
- Do not distribute any course materials (slides, homework assignments, solutions, notes, etc.) without permission.
- Do not photograph or record lectures (audio or video) without permission.
- If you commit to working with a partner on an assignment, do your fair share of the work.
- If you have a problem or complaint, let the instructor(s) know immediately. Maybe we can fix it!
